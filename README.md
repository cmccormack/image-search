# Image Search Abstraction Layer
A full stack JavaScript app that allows you to search for images

**Objective:** Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to [this](https://cryptic-ridge-9197.herokuapp.com/api/imagesearch/lolcats%20funny?offset=10).

Fulfill the below user stories:

* User Story: I can get the image URLs, alt text and page urls for a set of images relating to a given search string.
* User Story: I can paginate through the responses by adding a ?offset=2 parameter to the URL.
* User Story: I can get a list of the most recently submitted search strings.
